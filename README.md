# evidence_maps

Evidence maps are a way of visually displaying the body of literature in a specific field in order to show gaps in evidence or study characteristics. 

This shiny application will allow for the interactive exploration of the literature through tools such as evidence maps and text searching. 

The application currently uses a dataset containing information about each evidence, such as author, publication date, and study characteristics. This information is then used to create an evidence map of all of the evidence as well as a free text search in order to search the evidence in the dataset by their title or author.


Future plans for this application are:

- To extract keywords from literature within the dataset
- To allow the user to pull additional literature into the application
- To allow the user to download literature within the dataset
- To have an application that can be repurposed to work with evidence from a range of different fields.
